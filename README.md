# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A simple yet powerful **Password Strength Checker** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — designed to analyze the strength of user passwords in real time.  
This project demonstrates core **cybersecurity principles** such as password entropy, complexity evaluation, and user awareness for secure password creation.

## 🧠 Overview

This web app allows users to test their passwords instantly.  
It evaluates password strength based on multiple security factors and provides visual feedback using color-coded strength bars.

### 🔍 Key Features
- ✅ Real-time password analysis  
- ✅ Strength scoring based on complexity (length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)  
- ✅ Dynamic color bar with feedback  
- ✅ Clean, responsive, and modern UI  
- ✅ Lightweight (no external libraries)  
- ✅ Perfect for cybersecurity portfolio or SOC internship applications

## 🧩 How It Works

The JavaScript code checks the password against five key rules:

| Rule | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Length | Must be 8+ characters |
| Uppercase | Must contain at least one uppercase letter |
| Lowercase | Must contain at least one lowercase letter |
| Digits | Must contain at least one numeric character |
| Special Characters | Must contain at least one symbol (@, $, !, %, *, ?, &, etc.) |

Each rule contributes to the total **strength score (0–5)**.  
The app displays both **visual (color bar)** and **textual** feedback such as:
> Very Weak ❌ | Weak ⚠️ | Fair ⚙️ | Good ✅ | Strong 💪
